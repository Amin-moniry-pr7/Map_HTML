          <h3>📌Each area defines a specific clickable region on the image using coordinates. The shape attribute determines the region type, such as rect for rectangles, circle for circles, and poly for polygons. The coords attribute specifies the exact position of the clickable area. The href attribute links the area to a specific URL. The onclick event ensures that clicking the area opens the link in a new tab without navigating away from the current page📌</h3>
